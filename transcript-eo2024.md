# Cyborg Security - Everything Open 2024 - Transcript

Hello from the future! Or, at least, one possible version of the future. I come to you from a world where humans frequently explore space. We've sent people to Mars, all over the solar system, and beyond. This is also a world where we frequently augment ourselves. From- very basic, low-tech augmentations, to full implantations - the complete cyborg kit. Today, I will be briefing you on how we got here; what this version of the future looks like; and some of the possible benefits and pitfalls that we might run into as we evolve towards a fully cybernetic world. Welcome to Cyborg Security. So you're here because you want to be a cyborg. But before we get into the specifics of this, it would probably benefit us to talk about how these sorts of devices work, and how we actually got here. Cyborg Security, or- the idea of augmenting ourselves, is not a new idea. It's not even a particularly futuristic idea. We've been doing this for thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, in very low-tech ways. Things like glasses - walking canes - wheelchairs, and many other devices that I don't have here to demonstrate to you. This, incidentally, is why I'm qualified to give you this talk. I have experience with both low-tech augmentations and the tech behind the sorts of high-tech augmentations in the future from which I'm speaking to you. Now, these sorts of low-tech devices - in the field of medico-cybernetics, or what would become medico-cybernetics - evolved into more technologically advanced devices. And medico-cybernetics was really the first place where the concept of being a c- a proper cyborg - a cyborg wired up to computers and things - really took hold. In, sometimes, some very, very interesting ways. Because these sorts of low-tech augments - glasses, walking canes, wheelchairs - began to evolve into electric scooters. They began to involve into- they began to evolve into powered devices. And one of the places that that eventually took us, from the original low-tech pacemaker - and we'll come back to the pacemaker story in a minute - was into full heart replacement devices. Now, this is from slightly before the present from which I am speaking. These heart replacement devices were basically implanted inside the bodies of people who were on the waiting list for a heart transplant. The idea was that they would augment the function of people- the hearts of people who had congestive heart failure, so that they were able to continue to function until they were able to get a heart transplant. And this worked! Until it didn't. It worked until the devices started exploding. Devices, mind you, which are implanted in people's bodies. Now, the risk of wandering around the world with congestive heart failure is - if your heart sucks, it's going to continue to suck. And, as time goes on, it will probably suck worse. But this was where we got our first real look into the benefits and trade-offs that would come from this high-tech future of medico-cybernetics. Your heart sucks, it continues to suck! Or, you can get an augment which has the possibility of going up in an explosion. Then there's the issue of communications devices. So, as medico-cybernetics as a field began to evolve, it became very common for people to use - your people with cerebral palsy, some autistic people, people with speech impediments or other speech disorders - to use computerised augmented communication systems. One of the issues with these systems is that a lot of them- because they were very expensive in the early days of medico-cybernetics; they were generally subsidised or paid for by government programmes. This became very interesting, because a lot of these government programs had the presumption that devices- that these devices were all the same; that they could be easily switched out if something went wrong with one of them. But what you would find with these communication devices, these talkers, was that once people got used to the particular function and interface of the device that they used, it really did truly augment them. It became exceptionally difficult for them to actually be able to use a new device. So, when a young lady with cerebral palsy's device caught fire to the point where it was no longer repairable, you would have thought that the Arizona government would have simply provided her with a replacement. Instead she ended up in a scenario where she waited for well over a year to get a replacement for the device, and that essentially meant that her ability to communicate - which had been augmented - was significantly diminished. This is one of the problems that we're going to come across as we talk about medico-cybernetics. Once we start to change ourselves - once we augment ourselves - it can become very difficult to go back to a different way of functioning, from before this technology caught hold. And then there's the case of recreational cybernetics. Or, well- recreational-ish cybernetics. Because one of the pioneers, actually, of the field of recreational cybernetics was- or recreational-ish cybernetics, was a gentleman called Neil Harbisson. He was one of the pioneers of the cyborg rights movement. He was born with a condition called achromatopsia, which meant that he was not able to see colour at all. He essentially experienced the world in complete greyscale. He created a device which was attached to his head, which allowed him to basically perceive colour- I believe it was through vibrations? So this allowed him, through a completely different sensory pathway to the one that most people use, to be able to experience a facet of the world that he wasn't born with the ability to parse. Another aspect of recreational cybernetics - which took hold much quicker in the present that you're listening to me in - was the idea of RFID implants, or NFC implants. Basically: take a needle, y'know, stick a small chip under your skin, and you can program that and use it to do all kinds of things. On the other hand. One of the problems with that is; what happens if someone manages to hack the RFID chip or the NFC chip that you got implanted in your hand? What happens if some nefarious actor decides that they want to take over your pacemaker? This is not a scenario out of complete paranoia. Actually, ah, for many of you here, you'll be very familiar with Karen Sandler's struggle to get hold of the source code for her pacemaker. But there was also the issue of, erm - former Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney, who had a pacemaker implanted, but it was a national security requirement that the very early wireless function on this pacemaker was disabled, because they did not want people being able to hack into his heart. Elon Musk's Neuralink, as you're listening to me, has recently been implanted in its first human customer. And as you're listening to me, we don't know how that is going to unfold. I can present to you, from this future, one particular version of how this is going to look. But what happens when someone hacks into your heart? What happens if someone could hack into your brain? Again, welcome to Cyborg Security. In this version of our future, humans are wired up in all sorts of different place- eh, all sorts of different ways. We augment parts of our body that no longer work; such as, ah, in the case of the congestive heart failure; or parts of our body that don't work in the way that we think they should. What happens if you could attach yourself to, ah, what happens if you could implant your brain? What happens if you could augment the function of your arms and legs? What happens if you could - as present me frequently complains about the inability to do - just strap on a third hand? And then we're looking at a world where people can completely augment their whole bodies. We can strap ourselves into exoskeletons, which are able to do all sorts of different things that we can't do ourselves with the standard issue meatsacks that we've got. But naturally, all of these advances come with a flip side of various different types of problems. So let's take a couple of steps back to the medico-cybernetic case, and medical devices which are used to collect telemetry. I've been strapped up to several of these in my lifetime, and as a pioneer of- as a pioneer of certain aspects of cyborg understanding in my own right - and, frankly, for someone who has spent all of my life working with this sort of tech, quite a Luddite - one of the insistences that I have always had is that these devices which collect telemetry from my body are not connected to the Internet. If data needs to be transmitted, data can be transmitted perfectly well from some sort of storage device like an SD card which can be plugged- or, you know, the more futuristic equivalent of some sort of fancy tape drive, which can then be plugged straight into a machine. The reason for that is that- that telemetry data is incredibly powerful in its own right - but it's powerful when used in both the ways that we want to use it and the ways that we really, really don't. If you want a case study on this, Lana Brindley- Lana Brindley's talk here last year, about all of the data that she was- has been able to collect from, ah, various types of blood glucose monitors for the purposes of diabetes- monitoring, is an amazing case study in how this works when it's done right. But the case study in how this works when it's done wrong is the case study that the US government spooks of the early s were absolutely terrified about: that, with a lot of these devices, it's possible for someone wh- if someone is able to get hold of these devices and reverse-engineer them, it's possible for people to do all sorts of things that we might not want them to do with that data. We talk about attack surfaces and attack vectors into computerised systems as they function today, but- in the present, we don't really have a good understanding yet of what it means when these attack vectors are part of us - when they are fundamentally part of the way that we function. What happens if someone hacks your communication device - which is plugged into your body - so that it no longer gives the output that you want it to give? What happens if someone takes that telemetry that some sort of medical device is collecting on you, and decides This is really good! I can use this to figure out how to remotely screw with you!' Collecting data from all sorts of different data sources; taking it and augmenting it to build a picture - not just of the person, not just of what goes on in the person's head, like social engineering attack vectors that many of you here would be familiar with - but build a picture of what goes on in a person's body. So, to go back to a case study that is one that we could consider in the present: what happens if someone hacks or skims that RFID chip or NFC chip that you have implanted in your hand? RFID and NFC are really common standards, but RFID skimming is also an extremely well-known problem. So, if you have an RFID chip which is implanted in your hand - obviously, you're potentially going to have the ability to reprogram that, but if your attacker suddenly decides 'Okay, well, if I'm going to meet you at location X and shake hands with you, what happens if I have an RFID skimmer just sitting in my hand as I shake hands with you? I can pull down that data from the augmentation and then use it to do all sorts of nefarious things, potentially!' So are we going to end up in a situation where in order to not have people cloning the RFID chips in our bodies - the data on those chips - are we going to end up in a situation where we have to wear gloves all the time to protect against that? I mean, from the future, I can say that RFID-blocking gloves have definitely become a fashion item in much the say- in much the same way as RFID-blocking wallets are in the present. But the other aspect of this to consider is not just how we protect against attacking of augmentations in a hardware sense, like through RFID-blocking gloves, but how we protect against them in a software sense. So, as augmentations become more complicated; as augmentat- as augmentations become more deeply implanted, it's going to become more and more critical to consider both hardware-based attack vectors and software-based attack vectors. There's a very well-known case of a journalist who actually did some research on the pacemaker that he had implanted in his body. And one of the decisions that he made as a result of that, which greatly upset his present-day doctors - who were pioneers in the field of medico-cybernetics, maybe for some very interesting reasons - was that he simply turned off the update function. He set it up so that it was completely impossible for his pacemaker to connect to devices to be updated, because he no longer felt safe with his body having that interface to the public Internet of Things. What happens if a malicious attacker takes over- or a malicious actor, rather, takes over the servers of the company that owns your cybernetic hardware implant and pushes out a malicious update to everybody's pacemakers which stops them from working? It hasn't happened - in the present. In the future? I can't say. The- the lessons that were learned from Elon Musk's Neuralink, about which - I can't be too specific, I'm sorry; I have to keep some secrets - evolved into- or we took these lessons and we were able to use them to evolve the field of recreational cybernetics; to allow us to do things that we hadn't been able to previously imagine that we could do. Think taking the Wright brothers' original aeroplanes, and sizing them down to an exoskeleton which we could strap on, which would allow us to fly. Bulky exoskeleton, nonetheless, but exoskeleton indeed. Problem with all of these sorts of situations - with the pacemakers, with the heart implants, with the future of both medico-cybernetics and recreational cybernetics is - to do this in more than just a hobby lab - to build these full exoskeletons in a way that's not riddled with bugs, the vast majority of them are going to end up being proprietary. Unless. Unless we have a world where open-source enthusiasts come together and recognise that this is the direction that we're going, and start to build these sorts of augmentations; start to build this future, the future from which I am coming to you, ourselves. Because, yes. It is so much easier to augment yourself when you have the might and money of big corporations or governments behind you. But - to borrow another adage from the excellent Lana Brindley, open-source bad is better than closed-source bad. If you want to implant an RFID chip or an NFC chip into your hand, if you want to build some sort of augmentation which will compensate for some limitation of your body, or allow you to expand your horizons - the best way to make sure that you are building it in a safe way, in a secure way, and in a way where it's going going to continue to function is to get other people's feedback on it. The problem with all of these proprietary devices - from the very early communication systems, to pacemakers to exploding hearts, to the future where we have exoskeletons that allow us to fly, is that we cannot audit what is going on with these machines. Karen Sandler, a name that many of you here will be familiar with, has been on - I think it's a multi-decade quest now, to get access to the source code for the pacemaker that is implanted into her body. Even in the present, where you're listening to me speak, it is not uncommon for people to have devices implanted into their body that they have absolutely no control over the functions of; and, moreover, that they have no oversight over whatsoever. But if a bunch of curious open-th- source enthusiasts comes together in home labs, implants some RFID chips and NFC chips, evolves that and shares the schematics, shares the source code, shares the information, having more eyes on this is going to help us audit the cyborg future. What if we could have useful medical argumentations like pacemakers, communication devices, where the source code is all open and visible? Where the limitation to being able to understand what's going on with your body - or at least, what's going on with the augmentations that are so much a part of you now that you can't imagine the world without them - is not the resources and money of big corporations, but- your ability to understand the source code? Your ability to understand the schematics. And that auditing function ends up being absolutely critical for the future of cyborg security. So. Let's make the argument that we should all, in the present, be interested in this. Because we don't know, even though I'm coming to you from one possible version of the future, we don't know yet how this future is going to go. We don't know what it's going to look like when we all become cyborgs. It's creeping up on us remarkably quickly. And we don't know what the limitations of this future are yet. We don't know whether the limitations are time. We don't know whether the limitations are money. We don't know whether the limitations are resources. We don't know whether the limitations are going to turn out to be simple laws of physics. The reality of this is- is that it's still possible for one person, like Neil Harbisson, to decide that they're frustrated with some limitation of their body, and they want to augment it. So much of the world that we live in, as illustrated by recent present-tense events, relies on open-source software. And when that goes right, it goes perfectly right. But when it goes wrong, it can go really, really wrong. So part of the question here is: what happens if, rather than jumping into building a complex cyborg future, we start simple? Sit down, figure out the parts of our bodies that we want to change. Start with the hardware. Start with the glasses, start with the walking canes, and then figure out how to use software to sensibly augment it. And that may mean that if you want to be a cyborg, you will end up electing - like me - to be the c- the type of cyborg that does not want your data processed through the Internet of Things. Because, as I said when talking about telemetry, that data can be incredibly valuable. But right now, we can only use people's data to build up a picture of- well, almost only- the commonly available data on people can be used to build up a picture of what's going on in their mind. But it's not so easy, with the current technology that we have in present-tense, to build up a picture of what's going on in people's bodies. There is an incredible treasure trove of medico- of medico-cybernetic data out there just sitting and waiting to be harnessed. And if we can gain that data on ourselves, there are all sorts of cool things that we can potentially do with it. A great example of this, and- one of the big open-source wins in early medico-cybernetics, which- actually relied on a security vulnerability - we'll get back to that - and also one of my favorite topics whenever I speak at conferences, erm, was the original OpenAPS closed-loop system for people with diabetes. Basically, you take a Medtronic MiniMed insulin pump with a critical security vulnerability, you hook it up to a constant blood glucose monitor, and that allows you to create a closed-loop where the insulin pump will respond to the data that the constant blood glucose monitor outputs. OpenAPS was one of the really early wins for open-source medico-cybernetics. And, in perhaps a startling departure from the way that the world in present tense often functions, manufacturers of insulin pumps saw this, and they saw the community around OpenAPS evolve, and many of them went 'This is absolutely brilliant! You know what we're going to do? Rather than trying to build this closed-loop system ourselves, where we have both a constant blood glucose monitor and an insulin pump, the open-source community has done the work for us! This is public! This is audited! I mean, it comes with no warranties, as the vast majority of open-source software does, but by all accounts, the feedback that has come back from people who use these open-loop systems to manage their blood sugar is that in many cases it greatly improves their health, because it means that the insulin pump can be constantly responsive to what's going on in their body and can essentially act as an artificial pancreas. So, what many of these device manufacturers did was they went 'The constant blood glucose monitor aspect of this, and how to get the data out, is a solved problem. So we're just going to make insulin pumps which interface directly with the already existing open-source systems, everyone can still audit the source code, and you don't have to pay huge amounts of money for the proprietary system. You can just go, acquire one of the compatible insulin pumps, hook yourself up to it, and - bonus - for many of the- for many of the successors of the Medtronic MiniMed insulin pump, it doesn't even require exploiting a security vulnerability. Because the reality is that, as we move into a world where humans are more and more augmented, these security vulnerabilities are going to be used in some really interesting ways. In the future that I'm coming from, there are many more OpenAPSes which come as a result of vulnerabilities in recreational cybernetic systems, in medico-cybernetic systems. The whole gamut. Where people realise 'Hey, there's something that I want to do. If I can figure out a way to get these two aspects of the cybernetic system to interface with each other, I can build the capabilities.' But then you end up in situations where the very same security vulnerabilities which can be used to evolve the cybernetic system can also be used to seriously screw people who have these dependencies. In short, enter at your own risk. But coming from the future, my advice is, as much as possible, insist on auditing. Use the manufacturers- use the devices from groups of people, from companies that allow you to actually audit what is going on. The more you understand about what is going on in your body - in your augmented body; the more that you are both informed on how you can evolve it yourself, and how you can protect yourself against the scenario where everything goes completely sideways with very little notice. So hopefully, this briefing so far has given you some ideas about how you can position yourself well in the augmented cybernetic future that we are heading into. And of course, because this is an open-source conference, I would be remiss if I didn't discuss the concep- if I didn't discuss in more depth the concept of building your own. There are many ways in which we can do this with a low or lower barrier to entry. There are all sorts of relatively cheap and well-understood components like, erm, the- many, many different types of small computers that are around. Erm, if one were to go and browse the Adafruit- the Adafruit front page, there are all sorts of components which can be used for these sorts of augmentations which are already available on the market. Many of them have primary uses in robotics, or in home automation, but there's no reason that they can't be used for people automation too. So, thinking about evolving that RFID chip or NFC chip in the hand - if you wanted to build a device which attached to your body or implanted into your body, how would you do that in a secure way that also allows you to play around? And - it may or may not surprise people to know that - my answer to this is, if you want to build augmentations - going back to the story of the exploding augmented hearts - the first rule of thumb should be to make sure that as little of that augmentation as possible is implanted in the human body in a way that would require invasive procedures to remove it. If you have a whole ha- if you have a whole heart augmentation which straps onto your body like that; yes, it's going to be a massive pain to carry the thing around with you, but if the actual implanted part is restricted to just the interfaces that are required to actually connect to the heart, then it's quite possible that if you find a fault with the device that you're building, you can swap it out for a competitor's model. Something which you can't quite do in the situation where that device requires, the device itself- where the hardware components that actually make the thing function, rather than just allow the interface with the human body, require invasive surgery to remove or change. So that's going to be rule one. From there, there's a series of different ways that we can consider this, and different tips and tricks that we can come up with for building your own systems. So - leverage other people's work wherever you possibly can. That's a really good piece of advice for the cybernetic future. There are all sorts - even in present day, not considering the future - there are all sorts of people around who are already doing this. Some of them are doing it out of necessity, some of them are doing it because they want to push the limitations of the system, and some of them are doing it because they want to imagine completely different ways to do this. So whether you're here because you think you'd benefit from the medico-cybernetic side of this, or whether you're here because you want to dive head-first into the recreational cybernetic side of it, look at what sort of devices are already out there. Look at what people have already done. Look at what's been released. Look at what's been reverse-engineered. Talk to other people who have similar problems to the ones that you have. OpenAPS could not have come into being as the work of one person. It required a community. It required discussion to be built out to the degree that it has, where its successors now interface with- now interface directly with commercial insulin pumps. And if you want to build something, start small. If you want to build an augumentation which interacts directly with the hands, start with the tips of your fingers. Then- then to the palms, then to the arms. Eventually you will end up with a devi- you may end up with a device which completes all of the tasks that you want it to do, but if you start small and gain a better understanding, that gives you a good foundation to build on. And this briefing wouldn't be called Cyborg Security if I wasn't going to give you the advice to always keep security in mind first and foremost. And - actually - that piece of advice has two sides to it. One side is, keep security in mind in terms of making sure that people can't get access to that telemetric data if you don't want them to have it. Keep security in mind in terms of 'Does this thing that I'm going to stick in my body really need to be connected to the Internet?' Keep security in mind in terms of 'Can I see the code? Can I audit the code? How easy would it be for someone to just come up and run an RFID skimmer against my hand?' But it's also, again, with the OpenAPS situation, worth keeping in mind security in terms of 'How can I push the boundaries? How can I push the limits?' The legality of of hacking into devices in your own body took many, many years to be settled into- into this future, into this one hypothetical future. But- even with the- murky situation that we have today, it's still very possible to reverse-engineer some of these components in completely legal ways. Actually, a project that I have in the very near future at some point is to go and tear down a portal- a portable ECG machine, and see if I can figure out what's actually going on with the thing. Some of them, p- even the ones that are not connected to the Internet, are incredibly powerful. And there's a hell of a lot that we could do in terms of- in terms of cyborg setups and telemetry, just by taking already existing devices and wiring them into - I don't know, a dashboarding system! It's maybe not the, erm, it's maybe not the type of cyborg augmentation that VCs are going to throw huge amounts of money at, but in terms of being able to take that data and get a tangible benefit from being hooked up to some sort of cybernetic machine; in the present, that's an untapped frontier. In the future, that can shake out in so many different ways. And don't feel that you have to push your boundaries beyond what you're comfortable with. Coming back to the situation of the communication devices which catch on fire; the exploding augmented hearts; in every situation where we want to augment ourselves, there is always going to be a trade-off. Without having an informed understanding of the benefits and risks, and - spoiler: even in the future, the structures that we exist in don't make that easy. Even if we do have an informed understanding of the benefits and risks, it can be really difficult to make a decision about whether we're better off with our hearts just continuing to suck, or whether we're better off with that small, medium, or, in fact, very significant chance in the case of the heart pump in question, of the thing just collapsing in a way that can cause significant damage. Because again, once the thing's been implanted, it's really difficult to go back. And that machine might cause significant- might cause significant improvement to your life, but every person has to answer the question for themselves about 'If I want to do this, what is the balance here? What's the cost-benefit ratio? Am I happy with the situation where my heart continues to suck? Am I happy with the situation where I don't have any way to perceive colour? Am I happy with the situation where I wear glasses, where I use a walking cane to get around? Am I happy with the situation where I am wired up to a portable ECG machine or a- guh- a CPAP machine for sleep apnoea, which is the more common case that's been in the news as opposed to the one that I've experienced myself, where the data just gets streamed directly back to Some Cloud Service Somewhere rather than being stored on an SD card, where there's that layer of physical protection through the system not being connected to the Internet of Things?' And that's a decision that only the person augmenting themselves can make. Whether you are here because you want to learn more about medico-cybernetics, whether you are here because you're seriously considering some sort of medico-cybernetic intervention, whether you're here because you already have an RFID chip or NFC chip implanted into your hand, or whether you're here because you're interested in building that exoskeleton which allows us to fly, the one thing that we all deserve going into the cybernetic future is to be fully informed, so that we can make our own decisions. Thank you.
